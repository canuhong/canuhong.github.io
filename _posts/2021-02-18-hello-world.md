I used [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) which is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered theme to set up my blog. It's actually a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). This is a plug-and-play Jekyll theme which you can use on GitHub Pages without even setting up a local environment.

**I'm not going to delete any of the template posts, because I might have to look back at those in the future to make my posts**
