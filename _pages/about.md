This is a personal blog by @canuhong. I am currently an econ undergrad at Korea University. My main area of interest is macro/finance. My hobby is playing League of Legends and reading. 

I made this blog by using [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie), a plug-and-play Jekyll theme which you can use on GitHub Pages without even setting up a local environment. Learn more about it [here](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie).
