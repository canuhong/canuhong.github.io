Just a rough draft for later use

### Step 1) Fork Reverie to your User Repository

[this repository](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) -> rename the repository to `yourgithubusername.github.io`

Your Jekyll blog will often be viewable immediately at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> (if it's not, you can often force it to build by completing step 2)

For adding multiple categories:

```md
categories: [PHP, Laravel]
```

## RSS

The generated [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) of your blog can be found at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io/feed>. You can see the example RSS feed over [here](https://www.amitmerchant.com/reverie/feed).
